# GPTracer
GP stands for graphics programming, and this is a ray-tracer. This project was built while reading Jamis Buck's excellent book, The Ray Tracer Challenge.
The program is currently configured to produce a rather basic scene at 100x100 resolution for speed purposes. This can only be changed by editing the source code and recompiling.
# Build Instructions
Clone the repo:
```
git clone https://github.com/butchhartman/GPTracer
```
Then, in the cloned directory, run:
```
cmake -S . -B bin
cmake --build bin
```
